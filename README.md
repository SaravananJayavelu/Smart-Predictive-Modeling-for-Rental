  Key Tasks:
 1. Data Preprocessing:
 Clean and preprocess the features and historical rental prices data, handling missing
 values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
 2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
 Identify key features that significantly influence rental prices. Perform feature
 engineering to create new informative features, such as proximity scores to important
 facilities.
 3. Model Selection:
 Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task, such as linear regression,
 decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. Consider
 ensembling or stacking multiple models for improved performance.
4. Model Training and Evaluation:
 Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training
 data. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error,
 mean absolute error) on the testing data.
 5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
 Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.
 6. Interpretability and Explainability:
 Analyze feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the predicted
 rental prices. Provide insights into how specific features impact rental prices.
 7. Deployment:
 Once a satisfactory model is developed, deploy it as a user-friendly web application or
 API where users can input property details and receive rent predictions.
 Expected Outcomes:
 The successful implementation of the house rent prediction model will provide property owners,
 tenants, and property management companies with a tool to estimate rental prices accurately.
 This will enhance transparency, aid in decision-making, and contribute to a more efficient and
 equitable rental market
